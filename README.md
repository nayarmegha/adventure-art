# Basquiat's Adventure Art Museum

An interactive, museum-like collection of elements and artworks that come together to tell the story of Brooklyn based artist Jean-Michel Basquiat.

See and interact with the work here: https://nayarmegha.github.io/adventure-art/

How to use it: From the first page, click the >> button to “Enter the world of Basquiat”. As you move the character through the elements on the screen, you can see links and other elements pop up which you can further interact with. For a better experience, go in order (start with the 1960s element and go from there) and if you're feeling adventurous, go in whatever order you like. The links take you to other web pages/videos/interviews. Make sure you find the “Create your own Graffiti” and use the tool to create some cool graffiti. Have Fun!
